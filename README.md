# Next.js Project

This project is built using Next.js, created with `create-next-app`. The layout and design of this application are based on a Figma design template.

## Getting Started

### Development Server

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### File Structure

You can start editing the application by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The page will automatically update as you save your changes.
